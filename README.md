<h3>About Me</h3>
Hello! I'm <b>Mainul Hossain</b>, a Scientific Data Analyst based in Estonia. I'm passionate about Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Applied Mathematics, and Computational Physics, and I love Computer Programming using different languages such as Python, C, C++, C#, and Java.

<h3>Skills</h3>
<b>Programming Languages:</b> </br>
Proficient in <b>Python</b> for data analysis, and machine learning. </br>
Experienced with <b>C, C++, and C#</b> for software development. </br>
Skilled in <b>Java</b> for desktop application development and Web app development. </br>
Familiar with <b>PHP</b> for web development and server-side scripting. </br>
Proficient in <b>JavaScript</b> for front-end web development and interactive web applications. </br>
Competent in <b>MySQL and SQL Server</b> for database management and querying. </br>

<h3>Projects</h3>
Here are some projects I've worked on:

<h3><a href='https://github.com/mainulhub/Lasso_Viscoelastic/tree/main'> Lasso Regression for Viscoelastic Material </a></h3>
<p align='justify'><b>Description:</b> In this work, the Lasso Regression technique has been applied to calculate the shear modulus of viscoelastic material from experimental data. This experimental data represents storage modulus and loss modulus for different values of frequency. This data has been collected from dynamic tests on composite glass specimens with a PVB interlayer. </p><br/>

<h3><a href='https://github.com/mainulhub/Lasso_Cluster_Viscoelestic/tree/main'> Lasso Regression and Clustering for Viscoelastic Material </a></h3>
<p align='justify'><b>Description:</b> In this work, the Lasso regression technique and KMean clustering have been applied to calculate the shear modulus of viscoelastic material from experimental data. This data was also used in the above project (Lasso Regression for Viscoelastic Material). Lasso has been applied in the above project where around 30 coefficients represent shear stress. Our aim in this project is to reduce the number of coefficients and to increase efficiency.  </p><br/>

<h3><a href='https://github.com/mainulhub/Differential_Evolution_Viscoelastic/tree/main'> Differential Evolution for Viscoelastic Material </a></h3>
<p align='justify'><b>Description:</b> In this work, the Lasso Differential Evolution technique has been applied to calculate the shear modulus of viscoelastic material from experimental data. This data was also used in the above projects. Our aim in this project is to reduce the number of coefficients and to increase efficiency. Differential Evolution technique provided better results than the previous data-driven techniques. </p><br/>
